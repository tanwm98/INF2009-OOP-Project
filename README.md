What was demonstrated in the game engine design

- The `Ball` class is essentially the AI portion of the game where collision detection and resolution are demonstrated
- The `Screens` are Main Menu, Game Screen, and Game Over Screen with sounds playing demonstrating output handling
- The `Paddle` class includes methods for moving the paddle based on user input demonstrating input handling
- The `EntityManager` class manages all entities in the game, including adding and removing entities, and detecting collisions demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction
